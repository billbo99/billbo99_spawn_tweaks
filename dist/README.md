# Spawn tweeks by billbo99

When players die let them be re-spawned with equipment,  but only so long as they have already put some effort into crafting the items first.

This Mod keeps a track of Ammo / Guns / Armor .. if the players force has made enough of a tier of equipment then let the player get some on re-spawn
